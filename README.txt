This is a python (v3) script that will parse either a text list of game names (one game per line) or a MyDiscussion specific post, then map these names to games in the Steam catalog, query some more information and output it in a nice dynamic webpage that allows filtering, sorting on many keys.
A simple bb code outputer is also included.

The outside dependencies are python itself, BeautifulSoup v4, CacheControl v0.12, Colorama v0.3, DateUtil v2, lxml v4.1, Requests v2.

This software is released under the GNU GPLv3 license.


Current issues:
- The difflib automatic mapping can result in some false positives which have to be caught either right away, or manually later (which is becoming a major issue with around 1000 games...). Because of that it's disabled unless overriden by an opt.
- The language support is a bit wonky. The static webpage is in French while the part generated by the script is in English. The currency is also only USD. It would be nice to have everything in the same language, for various languages/currencies.
